## Vectorisation, matrix operations, and readability

Vectorisation means the same operation is applied to every single number in a vector. Why is vectorisation so important? The answer is speed: vector operations in `R` are much faster.

Vectorisation is as important in `R` as in other interpreted languages, such as Matlab or python. Generally speaking, one should avoid using explicit loops in an interpreted language as much as possible.


```{r}
fsum1 <- function(x) {
  fsum <- 0
  for (i in 1:length(x)) {
      fsum <- fsum + sin(x[i])
  }
  return(fsum)
}
```

```{r}
fsum2 <- function(x) sum(sin(x))
```

We can compare the speed using `system.time()`:

```{r}
x <- 1:1e6 #runif(1e+06, min=-1, max=1)
system.time(fsum1(x))
system.time(fsum2(x))
```

As can been seen in this example, vectorised code is not only faster but also more elegant.

## Matrix operations -- higher dimensional vectorisation

Let us say we want to write a function that simulate the following procedure $n$ times: we toss a fair coin 100 times and return the number of heads from these 100 tosses. That is, the function should return $n$ numbers, each of which is between 0 and 100.

```{r}
coin_toss1 <- function(n) {
  output <- rep(0, n)
  for (i in 1:n) {
    num_heads <- 0
    for (j in 1:100) {
      num_heads <- num_heads + sample(c(0,1), 1)
    }
    output[i] <- num_heads
  }
  return(output)
}
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
coin_toss2 <- function(n) {
  tosses <- matrix(sample(c(0,1), n*100, replace=TRUE), nrow=n, ncol=100)
  return(rowSums(tosses))
}
num_heads <- coin_toss2(10000)
hist(num_heads, breaks=50)
```

Let us compare the speed using `system.time()`.

```{r}
n <- 10000
system.time(coin_toss1(n))
system.time(coin_toss2(n))
```

Generally speaking, more layers of loops result in higher speedup if the code is properly vectorised. Having 3 layers of loops or higher should be avoided in an interpreted language such as `R`.

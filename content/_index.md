# Statistical Computing 1

This is the website with materials for the first computing unit of the taught component of the [Computational Statistics and Data Science (COMPASS) PhD programme](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/cdt/compass/).

The [unit description](https://www.bris.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/UnitDetails.jsa?ayrCode=20%2F21&unitCode=MATHM0039) provides further details on the unit.

This unit should provide researchers in computational statistics with core computational skills that can be used in both theoretical and applied research.

This unit focuses on the R programming language, because it is a fairly easy to learn high-level language with a healthy data science community. Most of the ideas apply straightforwardly to other programming languages.

      <description>Entering commands directly Entering commands from a script   Entering commands directly The console can be used to use R interactively. You can input commands at the prompt, and they will be executed if they are valid R commands. For example, an input of 1+2 at the prompt outputs [1] 3.
1 + 2 ## [1] 3 The [1] can be ignored: [1] 3 just means that the first element of the output is 3.</description>

      <description>Variables and values Arithmetic Conditional statements Relational and logical operators Functions Getting help Vectors Vector types Matrices Lists Basic scoping Pass by value semantics Iteration: while and for loops Recursion Errors, warnings and messages Special values   This page provides a very brief introduction to general R programming, and is sufficient to perform very complicated computations. It is certainly not comprehensive, however, and it is expected that one will need to supplement the information here with other material, and some healthy experimentation.</description>

      <description>Creating synthetic data Creating a data frame Saving and loading CSV data Saving and loading in Râ€™s data format Performing a simple linear regression   This page introduces a few basics ways to deal with data in R.
Creating synthetic data R has many functions for simulating random variates from common distributions, as well as evaluating their density / mass functions, distribution functions and quantile functions. For example, the Uniform(0,1) distribution is served by the functions</description>
